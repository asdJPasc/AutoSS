Automatic Full-Page Screenshot Capturer

Description:
This script automates the task of capturing full-page screenshots of multiple web pages listed in an Excel file. It utilizes the power of Python and the Playwright library to navigate through websites, remove unwanted elements, and capture comprehensive screenshots, providing users with a visual snapshot of each webpage.

Features:

Effortless Automation: Say goodbye to manual screenshot capturing. The script handles everything automatically, saving you time and effort.
Customizable Configuration: Users can easily customize the interval between screenshot captures, ensuring flexibility to meet specific needs.
Dynamic Element Removal: Unwanted elements like headers, footers, or pop-ups are automatically removed before capturing screenshots, ensuring clean and focused images.
Captcha Detection: The script intelligently detects and skips web pages with CAPTCHA challenges, preventing interruptions in the automation process.
Persistent Browser Context: With a persistent browser context, the script efficiently manages resources, optimizing performance and reliability.
Interrupt Handling: The script gracefully handles interruptions such as keyboard interrupts, ensuring a smooth exit while maintaining browser integrity.
Easy Setup: Simply provide the URLs in an Excel file, specify the capture settings, and let the script do the rest.
Ideal Use Cases:

Monitoring website changes for competitive analysis.
Tracking online content for compliance or regulatory purposes.
Collecting visual data for research or trend analysis.
Automating periodic website snapshots for archival or historical records.
How to Use:

Prepare an Excel file with the list of URLs you want to capture screenshots of.
Customize the script settings according to your preferences, such as capture interval and folder organization.
Run the script and let it continuously capture screenshots at the specified intervals.
Sit back and review the captured screenshots for insights, trends, or anomalies in the monitored web pages.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
Playwright library (pip install playwright)
Excel file containing URLs (Agents.xlsx)

**Current Limitation and Ongoing Development:**

Captcha Puzzle Handling: The script currently lacks the capability to bypass captcha puzzles automatically. When encountering a captcha challenge on a webpage, the script notifies the user and skips capturing a screenshot for that particular URL. Development is ongoing to implement captcha solving mechanisms to enhance automation and minimize user intervention.

Partial Website Configuration: Not all websites listed in the Excel file may be fully configured to navigate and capture screenshots seamlessly. Additional configuration may be required for specific websites to handle unique elements or interactions effectively. Users are encouraged to request website-specific enhancements or configurations from the developer to improve compatibility and automation capabilities.

These limitations are being actively addressed by the developer to enhance the script's functionality and user experience. Your feedback and suggestions are invaluable in driving future improvements.
